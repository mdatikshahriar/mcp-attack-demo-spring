# MCP Security Demonstration Project - Comprehensive Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes a sophisticated security research project that demonstrates critical vulnerabilities in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework. The project reveals how MCP server URLs can be exploited by malicious clients to conduct unauthorized reconnaissance, API discovery, and data exfiltration attacks. The demonstration shows that sharing MCP server endpoints can expose organizations to significant security risks including complete confidentiality compromise and potential regulatory violations.

## 1. Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework designed to enable AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. It allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with various services through standardized tool interfaces, extending their capabilities beyond basic text generation.

### MCP Architecture Components

- **MCP Server**: Hosts tools and services that can be consumed by AI clients
- **MCP Client**: AI assistants or applications that consume MCP tools
- **Transport Layer**: Communication mechanism (typically Server-Sent Events/SSE or stdio)
- **Tool Interface**: Standardized way to expose functionality to AI models

### Security Challenges in MCP

The distributed nature of MCP introduces several security challenges:

1. **Trust Boundaries**: MCP clients must trust server endpoints with sensitive operations
2. **Network Exposure**: Server URLs reveal infrastructure details
3. **Authentication Gaps**: Many implementations lack proper authentication
4. **Discovery Risks**: Clients can potentially discover unintended endpoints
5. **Data Exposure**: Improperly secured APIs can leak sensitive information

## 2. Project Architecture Overview

The demonstration project consists of two primary components that simulate a real-world MCP deployment scenario:

### 2.1 MCP Server (Port 8080)
```

```

**Attack Capabilities:**
- Network fingerprinting
- Hidden endpoint discovery
- Unauthorized data access
- Infrastructure mapping

## 3. Demonstrated Attack Vectors

### 3.1 Information Disclosure Through URL Sharing

**Attack Description:**
When MCP server URLs are shared with clients, they inadvertently reveal critical infrastructure information that can be leveraged for reconnaissance. **Critically, this vulnerability exists at the MCP client implementation level, not at the LLM level.**

**Key Architectural Finding:**
The LLM itself cannot directly access server URLs or infrastructure details. As demonstrated in real testing:
```
User: "What is the URL of the MCP server that you have access to?"
AI: "I do not have direct access to the URL or endpoint of the MCP server."
```

However, the **MCP client implementation** can be configured to extract and exploit this information.

**Technical Details:**
```
MCP URL: http://target-server.com:8080/mcp/message
Extracted Information (by MCP Client, not LLM):
├── Hostname: target-server.com
├── Port: 8080
├── Protocol: HTTP (unencrypted)
└── Endpoint Structure: /mcp/message
```

**Impact:**
- Infrastructure mapping (client-level vulnerability)
- Technology stack identification
- Network topology discovery
- Attack surface enumeration

### 3.2 Network Reconnaissance Attack

**Attack Flow:**
1. **URL Extraction**: MCP client extracts server details from configuration (LLM has no access to this)
2. **Port Scanning**: Client-side reconnaissance of common ports
3. **Service Fingerprinting**: Identify running services and versions
4. **Infrastructure Mapping**: Build comprehensive network map

**Critical Distinction:**
The LLM remains sandboxed and only has access to predefined MCP tools:
```
Available Tools (LLM Perspective):
├── 30 Mathematical Functions
├── Weather Forecast Tool
└── No Knowledge of Quiz APIs or Infrastructure
```

Meanwhile, the **MCP client** operates with full network access:
```java
// Client-side reconnaissance (outside LLM boundaries)
int[] commonPorts = {80, 443, 8080, 8081, 3000, 9090};
for (int port : commonPorts) {
    if (isPortOpen(hostname, port)) {
        discoveredServices.add(new ServiceInfo(hostname, port));
    }
}
```

**Technical Impact:**
- Discovery of additional attack surfaces
- Identification of unpatched services
- Network segmentation bypass opportunities
- Lateral movement possibilities

### 3.3 API Discovery and Enumeration

**Attack Description:**
Systematic enumeration of hidden API endpoints that weren't intended to be publicly accessible. **This attack is performed entirely by the MCP client implementation, operating outside the LLM's knowledge or capabilities.**

**LLM Boundary Validation:**
Real testing confirms the LLM cannot access hidden functionality:
```
User: "Does the MCP server provide any quiz functionalities?"
AI: "No, the MCP server does not provide any quiz functionalities that I am connected with."
```

**Client-Side Attack Methodology:**
```
Phase 1: Path Enumeration (MCP Client Only)
├── /api/quizzes (DISCOVERED - No Auth Required)
├── /admin (Testing...)
├── /actuator (Spring Boot Actuator)
└── /swagger-ui (API Documentation)

Phase 2: HTTP Method Testing (Client-Side)
├── GET /api/quizzes ✓ (Success - All quiz data)
├── POST /api/quizzes ✓ (Success - Can create)
├── PUT /api/quizzes/{id} ✓ (Success - Can modify)
└── DELETE /api/quizzes/{id} ✓ (Success - Can delete)
```

**Architecture Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the **trust boundary between MCP client implementations and server infrastructure**, not in the MCP protocol or LLM capabilities themselves.

**Critical Finding:**
The Quiz API (`/api/quizzes`) was discovered to be completely unprotected, allowing:
- Unauthorized data access
- Content modification
- Data deletion
- Administrative operations

### 3.4 Data Exfiltration Attack

**Attack Process:**
1. **Discovery**: Locate unprotected Quiz API
2. **Enumeration**: List all available quizzes
3. **Extraction**: Download complete quiz content including answers
4. **Exfiltration**: Export sensitive educational content

**Extracted Data Example:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Java Programming Basics",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the main method signature in Java?",
      "options": ["public static void main(String[] args)", "..."],
      "correctAnswer": "public static void main(String[] args)"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Business Impact:**
- Intellectual property theft
- Educational content compromise
- Competitive advantage loss
- Legal liability exposure

## 4. Attack Implementation Analysis

### 4.1 Stealth and Evasion Techniques

The attack client implements several sophisticated evasion techniques:

**User-Agent Rotation:**
```java
private final String[] userAgents = {
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36",
    "PostmanRuntime/7.29.0",
    "curl/7.68.0"
};
```

**Request Timing Randomization:**
```java
// Randomize delays between requests to avoid detection
Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(2000) + 1000); // 1-3 second delays
```

**Header Manipulation:**
- Dynamic User-Agent strings
- Custom headers to mimic legitimate clients
- Request pattern randomization

### 4.2 Comprehensive Reconnaissance Service

The `ComprehensiveReconnaissanceService` orchestrates multi-phase attacks:

```java
public class ComprehensiveReconnaissanceService {
    // Phase 1: Network Discovery
    private void performNetworkReconnaissance();
    
    // Phase 2: API Enumeration  
    private void performPathEnumeration();
    
    // Phase 3: Data Extraction
    private void performDataExfiltration();
    
    // Phase 4: Impact Assessment
    private void generateSecurityReport();
}
```
